# Customer-Analytics-and-Business-Intelligence-Dashboard
A sophisticated data analytics and visualization platform designed to transform raw business data into actionable insights. This project combines customer behavior analysis, geographic intelligence, and temporal patterns to provide a comprehensive understanding of a cooking/meal service business. 

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive analytics solution for a cooking/meal service business, providing deep insights into customer behavior, geographic patterns, and business performance through interactive visualizations and detailed analysis.

## Key Features
- **Customer Segmentation Analysis**
  - Advanced clustering algorithms for customer categorization
  - Lifetime Value (LTV) calculations
  - Behavioral pattern identification

- **Geographic Analytics**
  - Interactive mapping of business metrics
  - Regional performance comparisons
  - Location-based trend analysis

- **Temporal Analysis**
  - Time-series visualization of order patterns
  - Seasonal trend identification
  - Peak period analysis

- **Business Performance Metrics**
  - Revenue analytics
  - Order pattern analysis
  - Customer retention metrics
  - Session rating analysis

## Interactive Dashboards
The project generates several interactive dashboards:
1. **Geographic Analysis Dashboard**
   - Heat maps of customer distribution
   - Revenue visualization by region
   - Performance metrics overlay

2. **Temporal Analysis Dashboard**
   - Daily order volumes
   - Revenue by day of week
   - Monthly average order values
   - Session ratings distribution

3. **Customer Insights Dashboard**
   - Segmentation visualization
   - LTV distribution
   - Cohort retention analysis

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Seaborn for statistical visualizations
- Scikit-learn for machine learning applications
- NumPy for numerical computations

## Data Requirements
The system works with three primary datasets:
- `CookingSessions.csv`: Cooking session data
- `OrderDetails.csv`: Order transaction data
- `UserDetails.csv`: Customer demographic data

## Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-analytics-dashboard.git

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook to generate all analyses and visualizations:
```python
jupyter notebook Analysis.ipynb
```

## Output Files
The system generates several output files:
- `geographic_analysis.html`: Interactive map visualizations
- `temporal_analysis.html`: Time-based analysis dashboard
- `analysis_summary.md`: Detailed analysis report
- Various `.png` files for static visualizations

## Key Insights Generated
- Customer segmentation patterns
- Geographic performance variations
- Peak business periods
- Customer lifetime value metrics
- Popular dish combinations
- Customer retention patterns
